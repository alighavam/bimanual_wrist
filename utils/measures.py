    Mean deviation captures the simultaneity of the forces of the fingers in trial. It is defined as the average of 
    the norm of the deviation of the forces from the ideal trajectory.

    sum from t=1 to T of: norm(F_t - (C' * F_t)/norm(C)^2 . C) / T
    where F_t is the force of the 5 fingers at each time point t and C 
    is the ideal trajectory that you can take to reach the target
    position (Here it is assumed that the ideal trajetory is a straight 
    line from the starting position to the ending position).

    Look Waters-Metenier et al. 2014 for more details.
